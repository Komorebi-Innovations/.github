Komorebi Innovations is an innovative fashion brand that recreates the beauty of nature. Our products are inspired by the Japanese phenomenon of **'Komorebi'**, which refers to the scattering of sunlight as it passes through the leaves of trees, creating a pattern of light and shadow. Our goal is to recreate this captivating interplay of light and shadow through our unique interactive designs.

> 木漏れ日 (komorebi): This is a compound of 木 (ko, “tree”), 漏れ (more, “leaking, coming through”), and 日 (hi, “sun; sunlight”). The term refers to sunlight streaming through the trees.
[木漏れ日 (komorebi) on Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9C%A8%E6%BC%8F%E3%82%8C%E6%97%A5#:~:text=%E6%9C%A8%E6%BC%8F%E3%82%8C%E6%97%A5%20(komorebi)%3A%20sunlight%20streaming%20through%20the%20trees.)

## 2. Product Vision

Products from Komorebi Innovations are more than just objects; they are experiences. As sunlight passes through our specially designed materials, it refracts and reflects, creating dynamic patterns of light and shadow. Each product is an individual interaction system, a dance of sunlight and shadow that changes with the passing of the day.

## 3. Product Goals

Our products enable users to become a part of nature's canvas, immersed in the gentle glow of sunlight and the shifting patterns of shadows. Experience the beauty of Komorebi and let nature's art become a part of your story.

## 4. Success Metrics

Our success is measured by the experiences our products provide to users and the satisfaction these experiences bring. We track these metrics through user feedback and product usage frequency.

## 5. Product Design

Our products propose an interaction system that involves three main elements: sunlight, intermediate materials, and transmitted light. When sunlight passes through an intermediate material, such as fabric or lace, it undergoes refraction and reflection, resulting in the formation of dynamic shadows and patterns on a projection surface.

## 6. Technical Details

The mathematical modeling of this interaction system can consider the following functions:

1. Sunlight intensity ($I_0$)
2. Incident angle ($\theta_1$)
3. Refractive index of intermediate material ($n_1$)
4. Refractive index of surrounding medium (e.g., air) ($n_0$)
5. Transmission coefficient (T)
6. Reflection coefficient (R)
7. Shadow projection onto a surface (e.g., skin or fabric) (S)

The relationships between these functions can be described mathematically using the Fresnel equations, which govern the reflection and refraction of light at the interface between two media with different refractive indices. The equations can be expressed as follows:

$$
R = \left(\frac{n_1 \cos \theta_1 - n_0 \cos \theta_2}{n_1 \cos \theta_1 + n_0 \cos \theta_2}\right)^2,
T = 1 - R,
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{n_0 \sin \theta_1}{n_1}\right)
$$



The relationships between these functions can be described mathematically using the Fresnel equations, which govern the reflection and refraction of light at the interface between two media with different refractive indices.

## 7. Product Usage

Komorebi Innovations explores various mediums and materials to bring the magic of Komorebi into everyday life. Our products are not limited to fashion. As sunlight passes through our specially designed materials, it refracts and reflects, creating dynamic patterns of light and shadow.

## 8. Feedback and Improvement

We seek feedback on our designs to refine the solution to achieve the best possible fit to user needs. Scheduling time for feedback from actual users throughout the design process will increase the team’s confidence that their solution accurately addresses the market problem.

## 9. Product Recommendation

Products from Komorebi Innovations are recommended for all individuals who wish to experience harmony with the beauty of nature. Our products enable users to become a part of nature's canvas, immersed in the gentle glow of sunlight and the shifting patterns of shadows.
